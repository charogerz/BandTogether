## Band Together [^1]
You are part of a group of musicians who are mysteriously transported back to the site of your first concert together. 
Figure out how to return to the present, or remain forever trapped in a symphony of time!

Explore the room using WASD or arrow keys, unlock clues by interacting with items around you, solve the puzzle, and escape with your team before time runs out to win!
